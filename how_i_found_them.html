      KAYA VC emphasizes raw talent and I completely agree —  it's foundational. 
      The ability to create new solutions and solve novel problems is the determining factor of success. 
      From personal experience however, I've found that raw talent isn't enough. 
      Raw talent without perseverance is a wasted headline and both without a clear motivation 
      is running in circles.
      
      
    </p>

    <p>
      That's why I focused on these three criteria: raw talent for insight and creativity, 
      perseverance for consistent follow-through, and motivation for long-term purpose.
      When all three are present, they reinforce each other and things tend to compound fast.

    Most are pre-IP, some have found their idea,
    others are still exploring. What stood out across all of them was the same thread: curiosity, persistence, and intent. 
    Most came through personal contacts, student communities, and early project circles,
    people I've either collaborated with, followed online, or been introduced to through mutual connections.
    </p>

    <p>
    I highlighted those where I felt each trait the strongest and have done that entirely subjectively. 
    I'm not claiming to know what makes a great firm, but I do know all of them make great company. 
    The kind you don't second-guess being around.
