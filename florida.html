    <div id="content">
        <p>
            I remember seeing a video of a guy running around in the Everglades National Park catching critters and I thought that it´d be an interesting thing for me to try. So I sold some of my belongings (note being 17 at the time, I didn't have many of those) and decided to fly to Florida. Landing in Orlando, I remember feeling rather underwhelmed – this isnt the Florida I remember from the videos! Nevertheless I decided to visit some of the places that were recommended to me and had a great time. I talked to just about everyone I met and have learned much about the american redneck way of life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Notably though I met Dave, who worked at the Serpentarium in St. Cloud. I was enamoured by all the different types of reptiles they had in their facility and I let him know. I´d like to think my genuine enthusiasm was a refreshment compared to the usual clientele of this roadside attraction, so much so, that I got to see much more of the whole operation than I would´ve initially guessed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The next summer and the summer after that, I was invited by Dave to go work at the very same facility, alongside him and the owner George. There I was involved in the animal welfare and handling of the most venomous reptiles known to man and I was privy to the whole antivenom production operation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Returning back to my highschool, I might have gotten too carried away with the whole ordeal and while trying to do my own pseudo-research on said venom, I caused much distress both to my educators at the time and local police authorities. Ive learned to be slightly more careful nowadays.
        </p>
            Despite never arriving to the Everglades, this experience shaped my life in many different ways, firstly I realised just how far one could get just by asking around! More importantly tough, it showed me how interesting life could be if you alow yourself to be geniounly curious.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks Dave and thank you George.
